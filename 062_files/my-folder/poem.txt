From variables to functions,

With classes and inheritance,
Our code is free from redundancy’s hindrance.

Oh C#, you make coding fun,
With your easy ways, and when we’re done,
Our programs run like a charm,
Thanks to you, they’re safe from harm.

So let us praise this language grand,
For making our work so much in demand,
For C# is a tool so nice,
It helps developers code with ease, and spice.
